\smashpp is capable of finding even very small similar regions in two sequences. However, we have found experimentally that when \smashpp is running in a very sensitive mode, there might be some cases in which the size of similar regions in the reference and the target are not balanced. These cases can be handled using ``-rb'', ``-re'', ``-tb'' and ``-te'' options, that can resize the beginning and ending guards of reference and target regions, respectively.
